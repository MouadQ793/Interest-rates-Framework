Interest rates are the core of the financial system -- they affect everything from the loans people take to build their homes to the complex structured instruments traded on Wall Street. Whether one is a regular person planning on financing a personal project or a massive financial institution trading derivatives, interest rates have a huge impact. That's why understanding how these rates move and change over time is extremely important.

In finance, different, fairly complex mathematical models are used to understand, and attempt to predict how interest rates behave. These models help banks, investors, and companies figure out where they stand and how much products such as bonds and loans are really worth. They are also key to pricing complex products such as swaps, caps and swaptions that heavily depend on future interest rates.

With this project I aimed to personally develop my knowledge of these short term interest models and how to implement them in python.

By the end of this project, I will have a solid understanding of how these models work, how to apply them and  why they are so critical for anyone working in finance especially in the world of quanitative finance.
